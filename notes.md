# Java Notes

## _this_ keyword :

- Used to reference the current object in java.

**Shadowing** : When the input parameter shares the same name as that of the instance variable, the shadow of the input parameter falls on the instance variable and the instance variable remains unchanged, this concept is known as shadowing.

- Due to shadowing, _JVM_ is unable to distinguish between variable and instance variable.
- To get rid of Shadowing, we use _this_.

### Example :

```java
class account{
    String name = "Bharath";
    void newname(String name){
        this.name = name; //this refers to reference variable rather than parameter.
    }
}
```

## Types of Constructors:

2 types of constructors :

- Default Constructor

```java
public class BankAccount {
    int balance;
    BankAccount(){
        balance = 5000;
    }
}
//BankAccount Ram = new BankAccount();
```

- Parametric Constructor

```java
public class BankAccount {
    int balance;
    BankAccount(int bal){
        balance = bal;
    }
}
//BankAccount Ram = new BankAccount(1000);
```

Can Object have multiple states at the time of its creation? If yes, how is it achieved?

> Yes, an object can have multiple states while creation. It can be created by _Default Constructor_ or _Parametric Constructor_. We can also have multiple constructors. See the example [here](./BankAccount.java)

## Constructor:

- A constructor is a **code block** that is used to initialize a object.
- It has the same name as the class in which it resides.
- It is syntactically same as a method. But it is **not** a method. Because we can not call a constructor again and again in a single lifetime of a object. We can call a method as many times as we want.
- Constructor is automatically invoked whenever an object of class is created. you cannot invoke a constructor.
- It is called an executed only once per object.
- Default Constructors are the ones which are created without parameters.

There are 2 types of constructors. They are

- Implicit Constructor
- Explicit Constructor

> The _Implicit Constructor_ only works when there is **no** constructor declared.
>
> If we have one or more constructors defined, JVM will not invoke a _Implicit Constructor_. We have to declare a _Explicit Constructor_.

If there are two constructors with same number of parameters, JVM chooses a constructor only when

---

When we create a instance variable, it gets created for every object. But incase of methods they don't get copied like instance variables, they belong to the class. Similarly, if we want a variable to be same for all objects (be wrt to the class) then we make it a static variable.

## Static Variable

A variable which belongs to the class is called as a static variable.

- **Perm gen** is a area which stores the _static variables_.

- **Heap** is where the objects are stored.

```Java
class Book{
    static int stock; // same for all objects.
    String bookName;
    double bookPrice;
    Book(String name,double price){
        stock++; // Keeps track of how many books are there.
        bookName = name;
        bookPrice = price;
    }
}
```

- We don't need to create a instance of the class ( _a.k.a object_ ) to access a Static Variable.

```java
System.out.println(Book.stock); // works.
Book book1 = new Book("name1",2000)
System.out.println(book1.stock); // works here too.
book1.stock = 20; // Will change the original stock.
```

- Static Variables are created when the class is loaded and they die when the class is unloaded.

- Static Variables are created because of **Memory Efficiency**.

#### What is a Static Method?

To invoke a static method, we don't have to create a object, but whereas the regular methods need to be invoked only after creating a object. But both the methods aren't copied for every method.

### Why is the _main_ method Static?

JVM invokes main without creating the filename-object. It directly invokes `filename.main()`. If we made it just `public void main()` instead of `public static void main()` then the JVM will not be able to invoke main directly. This is the reason for it being static.

**Deepa mam Answer:**

Whenever a method is declared as static, it can be directly invoked without creating an object. Static methods belong to class. So, as soon as the class is loaded into JVM, the static method is available to be invoked.

### Whenever you declare a method as static, instance variables cannot be used in this context. Why?

- Static variables can't use instance variables. They can, however, use local/static variables.

- This is also the reason for not being able to use non static methods in a static context.

- Memory for static members is allocated only once at class loading.

- Cannot use [**_this_**](#this-keyword-) or [**_super_**]()

> Can a reference variable be declared as Static? [Single ton designing pattern.]

## Initializers

> Read Initializers from the Internet.

- Run [This](./Bank.java) to see more about initializers.

`{ ... }` is called **Instance Initializer**, its called by JVM automatically before anything else, and if there are multiple then they are called in the order they are defined.

### Output :

```
Static Initializer Called something
Initializer 1 Called 1
Initializer 2 Called 2
2
```

#### Anything that is instance can use static but anything that is instance cannot use static.

### Why do we need Initializers?

- **Static Initializer :** In order to initialize static variables or to execute any piece of code when a class is loaded, we use static initializers.

- **Instance Initializer :** If we write a code and we need that to be executed when a instance is created, we use Instance Initializer.

- Initializers are executed before constructors.

### What is Constructor Chaining?

In a class, there can be several constructors present (overloaded constructors) and all these constructors should be invoked while creating a single object. Then we used the concept of constructor chaining.

We do this with `this(args);`

### Why do we need constructor chains?

Depending on the data available, different constructors are invoked, resulting in different states of the object. But, if all the objects need to come together and have the same state, then we need to chain these constructors.

## Order of execution

Lets see if [this](./Order.md) goes to 2 pages XD

## Inheritance

When one class (A) attains the state and behavior of another class (B), it is said to be following inheritance property. A is the child, derived, specialized. B is the parent, base, generalized.

- Instead of having repetitive code in the similar classes, we can save the common functionality in a common class.

- Changes made in the base class is affecting all the child classes.

### See Example [Here](./person.java)

- A parent class CAN'T access the state and behavior of child, but a Child CAN access all the state and behavior of the parent.

> Whenever a child class object is getting created, the base class object gets created prior to it.

- The objects are created like this :
  - when you say `deepa.name` it checks if `Teacher` has name, then if it doesn't then it checks `person` for the name.
  - When it finds the name it does not create a copy of instance variable for `Teacher`, **it creates instance variable `name` in the instance of the `person`**.

### Static variables are inherited to children.

## `super()` :

- `super()` is the reference to the parent constructor.
- `this()` is the reference to the current instance variable.
- It should **always** be in the first line of the constructor.

> Create a librarian and a principal. Each class should have its own state and behavior. Let the classes have only parameterized constructors. principle and librarian and teacher eat their lunch together after performing their duties.

### What is overriding?

When the child class / derived class requires the same functionality as the parent class but wants to change its implimentation, then it wants to re define that method in its own class. This process is called as over riding.

There are several rules for over riding :

1. The name of the method should be same.
2. Parameter list ( no. of parameters, data type, and order of parameters ) should be same.
3. Return type should be same / should be the subclass of the return type of the overridden method. ( Law of Covariance )
4. Access modifiers should not be restricted.
5. Final Method cannot be over ridden.

The one in parent class is over ridden, the one in child class is over riding.

## `final` keyword :

It's basically like `const` of python. All final objects are also usually declared as static.

We can use this keyword with :

### Instance Variable

---

You can only assign the value in one of 2 places, they are :

1. While declaring it

```java
class Person{
    final String name = "Bharath";
}
```

2. In the constructor

```java
class Person{
    final String name;
    Person(){
        name = "Bharath";
    }
}
```

### Local Variable

---

We can assign it while declaring, or do this :

```java
final String name;
name = "Bharath"; //immediately in next line
```

### Reference Variable

---

We can not change the reference variable's value (Memory address), but we can use the reference variable to change what it's referring to.

```java
final Person p;
p = new Person();

p.name = "Bharath"; // works fine
```

### Methods

---

Overriding can not be done on methods that have been declared as final. We can not change the methods once they are declared as final.

- But we can inherit these methods.

### Others

- Initializers and constructors can not be final, because there can be more than one of constructors and initializers. And we can not say that they wont be changed.

- Whenever the class is declared as final, we can not inherit the class anymore. Inheritance will get disabled.

> ## Take a look at [these](./questions/10%20questions/) problems.

## Abstract

Whenever a method is declared as abstract, it doesn't have any body.

### Why is it necessary for the subclass to override abstract methods?

When we declare a method as abstract, we are enforcing that all the children have that method. Even if we don't give it a implementation/ a body, we know that children will have to have that method and they will implement the functionality by adding their own body.

- When all the children of a class override a certain method, we should delete the body of that method and declare it as abstract.
- When the parent wants to enforce a method, but don't know how the children will use that method, it can define that method as abstract.
- If we don't want people to create objects of a given class, we can make it abstract.
- We have to

Whenever a method is declared as abstract in a class, class should be declared as abstract too.

### Abstract classes are made because :

- all methods abstract
- implementing it because a method is abstract
- don't want to have objects.

### why is a class abstract when a method is abstract?

If we create a object from the class, if someone calls the abstract method, that method will not have a body because its abstract, so it will not know its implementation.

### Why methods and classes can't be both abstract and final?

Final stops inheritance, abstract demands inheritance.

> ## Take a look at [this](./Cars.java) and also [this.](./car_plan.md)

and

> ## Go through [these questions](./questions/10%20questions/)

- An abstract class can have a mixture of both concrete methods and abstract methods(No body).
- The JVM tries to protect a disaster, which is a method we invoked on an abstract class. If the method which is abstract, where will the JVM search for the body? So it does not allow to invoke methods on a abstract class.

## Packages

We define a class / file to be in a package by writing

```java
package kmit;
class example {
    //code in example now belongs to package kmit
}
```

- To compile a class inside a package, we do `javac classname.java -d .` where `-d` stands for directory and `.` stands for current dir.

- When we run that command then we get a folder with name "kmit".

- All packages can access `public` things from anywhere.

- We run `classname.class` by running `java kmit.classname`

### Single ton design pattern

---

There is only one object in the whole system.

- See [this](./single.java) file.
